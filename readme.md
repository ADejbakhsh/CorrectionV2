My proposition for what should be correction V2
It aim to fix current issue.

The biggest one is the fact that we have to refresh all the time to find one.
This is not a good experience for the student and make what should be a formality a pain.



It will also diminish the friction for student to put correction slot, make insentive more clear.


Road map:
```
[] API
    [] connect
    [] see list of projet available to corrrect
    [] get coalition name and point

[] UI
    [] Calendar for the week
        []select time range
    
    []checkbox on the left with scroll bar
    []show fake point on the top right
    []min project selected
    []how many correction per week
```	

In real version:
```
[] Use correction to close gap between coalition (rubber band effect)
    [] only on super corrector
[] extra point for the coalition that corrected the most this week 

[] show for project that currently need correction
```
